# K-Means-K-Medians-
Determine k means and K-medians using Euclidean and Manhattan distance for each K value from 1 to 9


K-Means K-median Clustering
Assignment for University of Liverpool COMP527
•	The assignment.py file contains the clustering accuracy for precision. Recall, and F score values with graphical representation for each k means and K-median clusters.
•	The K-means and K-medians clustering without and with  normalization  is implemented between 37-102 and 248-309 respectively while recall, precision, and F-score for the same are implemented at 107-225 and 317--444 respectively
Running the code
•	The given Assigment.py can be run in spyder or pycharm
•	It is important to note the 4 different data files 'animals', 'countries', 'fruits', and 'veggies have to be loaded within the compatible software using .csv format to read the file in .csv format as shown in lines 9-24
